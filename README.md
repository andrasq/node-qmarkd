qmarkdn
=======

Quick little cli tool to format markup kind of like markdown, visually like github, but with some
small differences.  It's a little abridged and a little warped compared to markdown.

This started out as two-hour hack to apply some simple formatting my document; since then
it's been minor bugfixes; oh, and tables support.

This is a work in progress.  It has rough edges, but is usable.  It's compatible enough
with github markdown to render a reasonably close likeness of most README files.

The syntax currently is slightly different from github, but it works the way I like it.  It
also has some extensions brought over from another tool of mine.  This is a work in progress
and may change as I add/alter features or change my mind.
